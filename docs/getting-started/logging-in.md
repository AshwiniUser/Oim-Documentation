Let's see how you can get started with {{SITENAME}}.

# Windows
* On Logging in page: Once the installation is complete, {{SITENAME}} will be started automatically if you are doing installation on windows machine and you will be re-directed to the Getting started page in the default web browser. If the {{SITENAME}} is not started, you can start it manually as described [here](start-or-stop-service.md).
* For launching the application, click on the link **Launch {{SITENAME}}**. It will redirect to the login page.
* Log in with the following credentials:
  - username: admin
  - password: password

These are default credentials. You can change them after you log in.
