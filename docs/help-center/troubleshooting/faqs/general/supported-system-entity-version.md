## Description

There can be multiple queries as below: 

1. How do I know whether a system will be supported or not?
2. If I have one system {{#ifeq: {{SITENAME}} | OpsHub Migrator for Microsoft Azure DevOps |configured|integrated}} already and I want to upgrade that system to a newer version; how would I know whether the newer version of that system is still supported or not?
3. How would I know whether a specific entity type of the system is supported or not? 

## Solution

To know which systems, versions, and entity types are supported by {{SITENAME}}, refer to the [Systems Supported List](../../../supported-connectors/systems-supported.md) documentation.
