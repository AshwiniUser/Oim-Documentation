## Description

Azure DevOps systems provide the feature to edit and delete operation in comments.

## Solution

You can edit or delete discussion/comment from the systemsâ€™ User Interface.  
But right now {{SITENAME}} does not provide this feature.  
Once any comment is created in Azure DevOps systems, it will not be updated or deleted by {{SITENAME}}.
